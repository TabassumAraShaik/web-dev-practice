      Late into the evening, the university computer lab glowed like a neon spaceship.
      Students gathered around glowing monitors, debugging, building projects, and sharing ideas.
      What began as a quiet study night soon evolved into a collaborative burst of creativity.

      laughter, and playlists looping in the background. The more the clock ticked forward,
      the more inspiration flowed, like pixels dancing across the screen.
